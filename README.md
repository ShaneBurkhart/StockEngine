#Stock Engine

Written in Rails, Stock Engine nightly collects data for all stocks on the NASDAQ exchange.  Various calculations are done and 
spits out stocks that match my hardcoded material.  Currently there are no capabilities to alter search from what is hardcoded.
This app is merely suggestions and neither I nor the site can be held responsible for your losses or trades.  Gains are a 
different story ;)  The goal is to simply cut down the amount of searching I have to do personally.  This greatly decreases the time I spend looking for stock by trial and error.  If you want more info email, email me or check out the site.
